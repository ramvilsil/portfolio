                    My web development journey began not too long ago. Prior to web development
                    I've had a bit of previous experience building simple programs with Python and JavaScript.
                    <br></br>
                    I enjoy programming as a whole, not just web development, as I know it can and has changed the world.


                    <br></br> <br></br>
                    My aspiration is to design and deliver amazing software products to clients, regardless of the industry.
                    I find it amazing that a program I contributed to has the capability of reaching the hands of pretty much the whole world, anywhere in the world.
