                    I'm a dedicated developer with full-stack expertise.

                    I work mostly with the programming languages C# and JavaScript/TypeScript.
                    ASP.NET MVC is the main framework I use for web applications,
                    but I'm always open to adopting other technologies.

                    I've always enjoyed developing different sorts of programs,
                    not just web-based ones. I began programming in middle school, developing Python applications.
                    One of the reasons I enjoy programming is knowingÂ that a piece
                    of software I helped create has the potential to reach the hands of individuals all around the world.
